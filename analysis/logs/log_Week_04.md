## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
* Discussion of data standards. We briefly dicussed the HL7-FHIR data standard used in my field of Electronic Health Records
* How lab culture defines so many things and can affect the growth of a student / researcher?
* Authorship discussions


### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.
* Alternative mode of communications with researchers in the same field. Twitter etc.
* Dealing with academic expectations and setting a balance.
* Setting up of a MKdocs Github website template at (https://github.com/xinformatics/academicpages-mkdocs) and the html at (https://xinformatics.github.io/academicpages-mkdocs/pubs/)


### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 
* I already have a minimalistic Github website (xinformatics.github.io), so how can I use the MKdocs template for something other than websites?, Maybe a demo of a project??

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
* Continuing with the CyVerse Self-Guided Tour
